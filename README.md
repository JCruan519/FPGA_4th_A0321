# FPGA_4th_A0321

This is a repository of A0321 in the 4th FPGA competition. You can obtain the codes of this project about ‘Mechanical Arm Controlled by Brain Based on BCI and LightTCN Networks’ here.

The License about this repository is GPL-3.0 License.

LightTCN.py: you can attain the structure of this NN, which can be used to deal with the problems about time series.

train_funcs.py: functions in this file are necessary for training LightTCN.

train.ipynb: the main codes to train our NN.

predict_funcs.py: functions in this file are necessary for making a predict.

predict.ipynb: the main codes to transform raw EEG data to results and to control the mechanical arm.

STC_communication_codes.zip: these are the codes about the serial communication.
